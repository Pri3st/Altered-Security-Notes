### 1. ASREPRoast ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- The pre-authentication phase (**KRB_AS_REQ**) requires the requesting user to supply its secret key (DES, RC4, AES128 or AES256) derived from the user password.
- When asking the KDC for a TGT, the requesting user needs to validate pre-authentication by sending a timestamp encrypted with it's own credentials. It ensures the user is requesting a TGT for himself.
- Once validated, the TGT is then sent to the user in the `KRB_AS_REP` message, but that message also contains a session key. That session key is encrypted with the requested user's NT hash.
- Because some applications don't support Kerberos preauthentication, it is common to find users with Kerberos preauthentication disabled.
#### What the attack is about. ####
- The ASREPRoast attack looks for **users without Kerberos pre-authentication required attribute** (**DONT_REQ_PREAUTH**).
- Attackers can request TGTs for these users and try to crack the session keys offline.
- **No domain account is needed to perform this attack**, only connection to the DC.

### 2. Kerberoast ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- When asking the KDC (Key Distribution Center) for a Service Ticket (ST), the requesting user needs to send a valid TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) and the service name (`sname`) of the service wanted. If the TGT is valid, and if the service exists, the KDC sends the ST to the requesting user.
- Multiple formats are accepted for the `sname` field: servicePrincipalName (SPN), sAMAccountName (SAN), userPrincipalName (UPN), etc.
- The ST is encrypted with the requested service account's NT hash. If an attacker has a valid TGT and knows a service (by its SAN or SPN), he can request a ST for this service and crack it offline later in an attempt to retrieve that service account's password.
- In most situations, services accounts are machine accounts, which have very complex, long, and random passwords.
#### What the attack is about. ####
- The goal of **Kerberoasting** is to harvest **TGS tickets for services that run on behalf of user accounts** in the AD, not computer accounts. Thus, **part** of these TGS **tickets are** **encrypted** with **keys** derived from user passwords. As a consequence, their credentials could be **cracked offline**. You can know that a **user account** is being used as a **service** because the property **"ServicePrincipalName"** is **not null**.
- Therefore, to perform Kerberoasting, only a domain account that can request for TGSs is necessary, which is anyone since no special privileges are required.
- **You need valid credentials inside the domain.**

### 3. KUD ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- Unrestricted kerberos delegation is a privilege that can be assigned to a domain computer or a user;
- Usually, this privilege is given to computers (in this lab, it is assigned to a computer IIS01) running services like IIS, MSSQL, etc.;
- Those services usually require access to some back-end database (or some other server), so it can read/modify the database on the authenticated user's behalf;
- When a user authenticates to a computer that has unresitricted kerberos delegation privilege turned on, authenticated user's TGT ticket gets saved to that computer's memory;
- The reason TGTs get cached in memory is so the computer (with delegation rights) can impersonate the authenticated user as and when required for accessing any other services on that user's behalf.
- Essentially this looks like so: `User` --- authenticates to ---> `IIS server` ---> authenticates on behalf of the user ---> `DB server`
	1. _User1_ requests a TGS for _ServiceZ_, of _UserZ_.
	2. The KDC checks if _UserZ_ has the _TrustedForDelegation_ flag set (Yes).
	3. The KDC includes a TGT of _User1_ inside the TGS for _ServiceZ_.
	4. _ServiceZ_ receives the TGS with the TGT of _User1_ included and stores it for later use.

#### What the attack is about. ####
- If an account (user or computer) with unconstrained delegations privileges is compromised, an attacker can:
	- Wait for a privileged user to authenticate on it using Kerberos.
	- Force a computer, using a coercion method, such as PrinterBug, to authenticate to the compromised machine using Kerberos.
	- **Dump the tickets and impersonate the users** on any machine.
- The attacker service will retrieve an ST (service ticket) containing the user's TGT.
- That TGT will be used by the service as a proof of identity to obtain access to a target service as the target user.
- Alternatively, the TGT can be used with [S4U2self abuse](/ad/movement/kerberos/delegations/s4u2self-abuse) in order to gain local admin privileges over the TGT's owner.

### [[4. KCD]] ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- Kerberos constrained delegation was introduced to provide a safer form of delegation that could be used by services.
- When it is configured, constrained delegation restricts the services to which the specified server can act on the behalf of a user.
- This requires domain administrator privileges to configure a domain account for a service.
- It also restricts the account to a single domain.
- Kerberos is unable by itself to create special tickets to implement delegation for specific groups of services. For this reason Microsoft implemented 2 Kerberos extensions that allow it to obtain this desired behavior:
	- **Service for User to self (****_S4U2self_****):** If a **service account** has a _userAccountControl_ value containing `TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION`, then it can obtain a TGS for itself (the service) on behalf of any other user.
	- **Service for User to Proxy(****_S4U2proxy_****):** A **service account** could obtain a TGS on behalf any user to the service set in `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo.` To do so, it first need a TGS from that user to itself, but it can use S4U2self to obtain that TGS before requesting the other one.
- Essentially this looks like so: `User` --- authenticates to ---> `IIS server` ---> authenticates on behalf of the user ---> `DB server` (only for services that have been explicitly specified)
	1. User1_ sends the TGS to _ServiceZ_.
	2. _ServiceZ_, owned by _UserZ_, uses this TGS to ask the KDC for a TGS for _ServiceX_ on behalf of _User1_.
	3. The KDC checks:
	    1. If _ServiceX_ is listed in _UserZ_ _msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo_ (Yes).
	    2. If the sent TGS is _forwardable_ (Yes). Constrained Delegation is applied.
	4. The KDC returns a TGS to _ServiceZ_ to interact with _ServiceX_ on behalf of _User1_.
	5. _ServiceZ_ uses the new TGS to interact with _ServiceX_, by impersonating _User1_.
![[S4U2Proxy_constrained_delegation.webp]]

#### What the attack is about. ####
- If a service account, configured with constrained delegation to another service, is compromised, an attacker can:
	- Retrieve the hash of the service in order to request a usable TGS for the services that the compromised service is allowed to delegate to.
	- Rettrieve the TGT of the principal (computer or user) trusted for delegation and pass it in order to request a usable TGS for the services that the compromised service is allowed to delegate to.
- This essentially allows the attacker to impersonate **ANY** user (except users protected against delegation) in the environment to access another service the initial one can delegate to.
- Moreover, the attacker **won't only have access to the service that the user is able to impersonate, but also to any service** because the SPN (the service name requested) is not being checked (since it in not a protected attribute).

### [[5. RBCD]] ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- RBCD is a different flavor of [[4. KCD]] wherein the Service Administrators or Owner of the resources are allowed to configure which accounts are trusted to delegate to them.
- RBCD can also be configured across the domains.
- This also shifts the decision of whether a server should trust the source of a delegated identity from the delegating-from domain administrator to the resource owner.
- Access is controlled by the security descriptor on the target resource instead of an list of SPN records. The security descriptor are stored in `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute of the target resource that is like a series of binary bytes.
- Essentially this looks like so: `User` --- authenticates to ---> `IIS server` ---> authenticates on behalf of the user ---> `DB server` (only for services that have been explicitly specified)
	1. _User1_ sends the TGS to _ServiceZ_.
	2. _ServiceZ_, owned by _UserZ_, uses this TGS to ask the KDC for a TGS for _ServiceX_ on behalf of _User1_.
	3. The KDC checks:
	    1. If _ServiceX_ is listed in _UserZ_ _msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo_ (No). Constrained Delegation cannot be applied.
	    2. If _UserZ_ is listed in _msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity_ of _UserX_, the owner of _ServiceX_ (Yes). RBCD can be applied.
	4. The KDC returns a TGS to _ServiceZ_ to interact with _ServiceX_ on behalf of _User1_.
	5. _ServiceZ_ uses the new TGS to interact with _ServiceX_, by impersonating _User1_.
![[S4U2Proxy_RBCD.webp]]
#### What the attack is about. ####
- If an attacker has **write equivalent privileges (GenericAll, GenericWrite, etc)** over a **Computer** account **privileged access** can be obtained in that machine.
- Specifically, the attacker can edit/populate the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute of the target computer, hence configuring that object for RBCD.
- For this attack to work, the attacker needs to populate the target attribute with the SID of an account that Kerberos can consider as a service. A service ticket will be asked for it. In short, the account must be either:
	- - a user account having a `ServicePrincipalName` set
	- an account with a trailing `$` in the `sAMAccountName` (i.e. a computer accounts)
	- any other account and conduct SPN-less RBCD with U2U (User-to-User) authentication
- The common way to conduct these attacks is to create a computer account, since Kerberos considers the SID of such an account as a service. Creating a computer is usually possible thanks to a domain-level attribute called `MachineAccountQuota` that allows regular users to create up to 10 computer accounts.

### [[6. Shadow Credentials]] ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- Whilst Kerberos pre-authentication is typically carried out using a symmetric key derived from a client's password, asymmetric keys are also possible via Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT).  If a PKI solution is in place, such as Active Directory Certificate Services, the domain controllers and domain members exchange their public keys via the appropriate Certificate Authority.  This is called the Certificate Trust model.
- There is also a Key Trust model, where trust is established based on raw key data rather than a certificate.  This requires a client to store their key on their own domain object, in an attribute called `msDS-KeyCredentialLink`.

#### What the attack is about. ####
- The basis of the "shadow credentials" attack is that if you can write to this attribute on a user or computer object, you can obtain a TGT for that principal.  As such, this is a DACL-style abuse as with [[5. RBCD]].
- It is stealthier than RBCD since the later requires control over an account with an SPN, and creating a new computer account to meet that requirement may lead to detection and cannot be cleaned up until privilege escalation is achieved.

### [[7. S4U2Self]] ###
#### What's running Under-the-Hood in Kerberos. ####
- The purpose of S4U2Self is to allow the use of Delegation to services that do not support Kerberos authentication, and therefore, are unable to get a TGS from the client user.
- To bypass this limitation, S4U2Self allows a service to request the KDC for a TGS for itself, on behalf of another user. This is also known as _Protocol Transition_.
- Essentially, **Service for User to Self (S4U2self)** allows a service to obtain a Service Ticket, on behalf of a user (called "principal"), to itself.
- S4U2self can be used to produce a Service Ticket to oneself on behalf of another domain user, **even if that user is "sensitive for delegation" or member of the Protected Users group**.
- This is essentially yet another variation of the Delegation Attacks.

#### What the attack is about. ####
- In the KUD attack, we may obtain a TGT for the domain controller (or any other machine account). However, If we try to pass that ticket into a logon session and use it to access the C$ share (like we would with a user TGT), it will fail.
- This is because machines do not get remote local admin access to themselves.
- What we can do instead is abuse S4U2Self to obtain a usable TGS as a user we know _is_ a local admin (e.g. a domain admin).
