#### 1. Kerberos Agents ####
- **Client or user** who wants to access to the service.
- **AP** (Application Server) which offers the service required by the user.
- **KDC** (Key Distribution Center), the main service of Kerberos, responsible of issuing the tickets, installed on the DC (Domain Controller). It is supported by the **AS** (Authentication Service), which issues the TGTs.

#### 2. Kerberos Tickets ####
The main structures handled by Kerberos are the tickets. These tickets are delivered to the users in order to be used by them to perform several actions in the Kerberos realm. There are 2 types:
- The **TGS** (Ticket Granting Service) is the ticket which user can use to authenticate against a service. It is encrypted with the service key.
- The **TGT** (Ticket Granting Ticket) is the ticket presented to the KDC to request for TGSs. It is encrypted with the KDC key.
		-> PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) represents an structure (included in almost all tickets) which contains useful information like security identifiers, group membership, user profile information, and password credentials. PAC is signed with the KDC key.
