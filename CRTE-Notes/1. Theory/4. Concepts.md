# Groups vs OUs
#### Groups
- A group is considered a `container object` because it can contain other objects, including users, computers, and even other groups. A group IS regarded as a security principal and has a SID and a GUID.
- In AD, groups are a way to manage user permissions and access to other securable objects (both users and computers).
	- Let's say we want to give 20 help desk users access to the Remote Management Users group on a jump host. Instead of adding the users one by one, we could add the group, and the users would inherit the intended permissions via their membership in the group. 
	- Let's also say that we want to give help desk users permissions to reset the passwords of domain users. Instead of adding those permissions to each help desk user one by one, we could add them to a group and assign those permissions to the group.
- In Active Directory, we commonly see what are called "[nested groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/nesting-a-group-in-another-group)" (a group added as a member of another group), which can lead to a user(s) obtaining unintended rights. It is excellent for auditing group membership and uncovering/seeing the sometimes unintended impacts of nested group membership.
- Groups in AD can have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm), the most common being the name, description, membership, and other groups that the group belongs to.
#### Organizational Units
- Organizational units exist **below the level of individual domains**.
- An **organizational unit** or OU is the **smallest unit within Active Directory** for which admins can define specific **group policy settings** and **delegated admin rights**. Organizational units can contain users, computers, groups and other OUs. Effectively, organizational units represent a **subsection of an Active Directory domain** that can be used to group objects together and assign unique rules to them. They serve **two main purposes**:
	- **Delegated administration**: Organizational units allow administrators to assign **admin permissions** to domain users. Those permissions are **only valid within a specific OU**. This helps **restrict the control of individual admins** in accordance with the **[principle of least privilege](https://www.tenfold-security.com/en/least-privilege-principle/)**. Delegation can also be used to allow **users outside the IT team** to handle certain helpdesk tasks like **password resets**. For example, we can group the employees of the Marketing Department to an OU called **Marketing** and easily assign **password reset permissions** to members of the **Help Desk** domain group, or a specific employee of the Help Desk Department.
	- **Managing group policy**: **[Group policy objects](https://www.tenfold-security.com/en/group-policy-objects-gpo/)** (GPOs) let admins manage a **variety of settings** for users and devices in Windows networks. Organizational units make it possible to **apply group policy to specific parts of Active Directory**.
#### Verdict
- **Organizational units** are used to **delegate admin permission** and **apply group policy settings**. --> **PASSIVE (things AFFECT OUs)**
	- Organizational units can contain group policy objects (GPOs), AD groups can’t
	- Organizational units can be used to delegate admin permissions, AD groups can’t
- **Groups** are used to **manage permissions.** --> **ACTIVE (Groups carry permissions)**
	- AD groups can be used to manage permissions, organizational units can’t
	- AD groups have their own **[security identifier](https://www.tenfold-security.com/en/wiki/sid-security-identifier/)**, organizational units don’t

# Domain Group Scoping
## Types of Groups
 - **Security** groups are used to control access to resources.  
 - **Security** groups can also be used as email distribution lists.
 
 - _Distribution_ groups can be used only for email distribution lists, or simple administrative groupings.  
 - _Distribution_ groups cannot be used for access control because they are not "security enabled."
## Group Scopes
- Security groups can have one of three scopes. A group’s scope affects what types of group objects can be added to it and what other groups the group can be nested in. From [ss64.com](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-groups.html):
	- Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. _Global groups can be nested within Domain Local groups, Universal groups and within other Global groups in the same domain._
	- Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. _Universal groups can be nested within Domain Local groups and within other Universal groups in any domain._
	- The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`. They are available to all domains within an organization and can contain users from any domain. Unlike domain local and global groups, universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC), and adding or removing objects from a universal group triggers forest-wide replication. _A Domain Local group cannot be nested within a Global or a Universal group._
![[nested_group_membership.jpg]]
- The **groupType** property is a binary bitfield, with the possible values broken out at the [bottom of this page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675935(v=vs.85).aspx) under ‘Remarks’. In order to search a binary field with LDAP, we need to use the [LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_BIT_AND](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223368.aspx) LDAP search syntax. This is the way to search binary fields through LDAP. Here are the filters for the associated searches:
	- Domain Local scope: **‘(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=4)’**
	- Global scope: **‘(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)’**
	- Universal scope: **‘(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8)’**
	- Security: **‘(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2147483648)’**
	- Distribution: **‘(!(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2147483648))’**
	- “Created by the system”: **‘(groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=1)’**
### Enumerating Domain Groups according to their Scope
- Domain Local scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope DomainLocal**
- Not Domain Local scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope NotDomainLocal**
- Global scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope Global**
- Not Global scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope NotGlobal**
- Universal scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope Universal**
- Not Universal scope: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupScope NotUniversal**
- Security: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupProperty Security**
- Distribution: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupProperty Distribution**
- “Created by the system”: **Get-DomainGroup -GroupProperty CreatedBySystem**
### Security Group Scopes Explained
#### Domain Local
- These are groups that are local to the current domain. That is, domain local groups are intended to help manage access to resources within a single domain.
- The fact that domain local groups can’t be added to global groups is an intended design effect: (domain local) groups that grant access to specific resources can not be added to _organizational_ groups (i.e. global groups), which can prevent some accidental group nestings that may lead to unintended access later on.
	- **Can be nested in:** _only_ other domain local groups, _from the same domain_
	- **Can contain:** _global_ groups, _universal_ groups, and _foreign trust members_
	- **Can be assigned permissions in:** the same domain
	- **Memberships replicated in the global catalog:** no
- **tl;dr**: if you want a group that can grant access _only to_ resources in the same domain, but can contain any other group scope (including users across an external trust) use a _domain local_ scope.
#### Global
- Global groups are probably the trickiest of the three scopes to understand. They are usually used as an organizational structure for users who share comparable network access requirements.
- Global groups also can not be nested _across_ domains, meaning a global group from one domain can’t be nested in a group in another domain. Also, users/computers from one domain can’t be nested in a global group in another domain, which is why users from one domain aren’t eligible for a membership in “Domain Admins” in a foreign domain (due to its global scope). Because global groups are not replicated in the global catalog (terrible naming conflict, I know) you can modify the membership of global groups without causing replication traffic to other domains in the forest.
	- **Can be nested in:** _universal_ and _domain local_ groups
	- **Can contain:** only _global_ groups, _from the same domain_
	- **Can be assigned permissions in:** any domain
	- **Memberships replicated in the global catalog:** no
- **tl;dr**: if you want a group that can be used in _any_ domain in a forest or trusting domain, but can only contain users from that group’s domain, use a global scope.
### Universal
- If you need a group that contains members from one or more domains within the same forest, and can be granted access to any resource in that forest, you need a universal scope. For nested group membership, all groups can be members of the same group type (for global this only applies to other global groups in the same domain).
- For universal groups specifically, any changes in the membership will propagate to the _global catalog._ I’ll cover all of these global catalog interactions in the next section.
	- **Can be nested in:** _domain local_ groups and other _universal_ groups
	- **Can contain:** _global_ groups and other _universal_ groups
	- **Can be assigned permissions in:** any domain or forest
	- **Memberships replicated in the global catalog:** yes
- **tl;dr**: if you want a group that can be given access to anything in the forest, and can contain any user/group/computer in the forest, use a universal scope.
### Best Practices for Active Directory Group Management
#### When Users Are in the Same Domain
- If users are part of the same domain, you should nest groups as follows:
	1. Add user and computer accounts to global groups
	2. Add global groups to domain local groups
	3. Grant the domain local groups access to resources
	4. Assign permissions to domain local groups for appropriate access
#### When Users Are in Different Domains
- If users are in different trusted domains, nest groups as follows:
	1. Add user and computer accounts to global groups
	2. Add global groups to universal groups
	3. Add universal groups to domain local groups
	4. Assign permissions to domain local groups for appropriate access
### Separating People and Resources
- It is tempting to use the same groups to hold users and also apply resource permissions but this seemingly simple setup will involve more effort to maintain.
- For example, you have a finance department with 25 accountants and clerks, they need access to the Crest system, they also need editor permissions on the intranet and they need access to all the shared Account_Balances spreadsheets.
- A common way to deal with this is to create 3 groups and add the 25 people to each:
    25       25           25
 \[CREST] \[INTRANET] \[ACCOUNT_BALANCES]
- The extra work starts when someone changes job or a new hire arrives, now someone has to remember and sort out which groups each of these people needs to be added to or removed from.
-  The better way of managing this, is to still create the 3 groups as before but also create a group called Accounting, put the 25 people into the Accounting group, and make all the resources available to the _group_ rather than to individuals.
               25
         \[ACCOUNTING Group]
  \[res_CREST] \[res_INTRANET] \[res_ACCOUNT_BALANCES] 
 
 - Now when a new hire arrives we add them to the accounting group and they will automatically get everything they need. Similarly when someone changes job we remove them from the accounting group and add them to a different group appropriate to their new role. Also note that this arrangement only requires 28 permissions to be set instead of 75.
 -  Separating people and resources also makes it easy to temporarily remove access e.g. during maintenance downtime. In the above example you could just remove the Accounting group from the res_Crest group. This is much easier than having to either remove (and then later accurately replace) a bunch of individual user accounts, or having to edit the actual permissions applied to files/printers/databases.
## The Global Catalog
- The [global catalog is a partial copy of all objects](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc728188(v=ws.10).aspx) in an Active Directory forest, meaning that some object properties (but not all) are contained within it. This data is replicated among all domain controllers marked as global catalogs for the forest. One point of the global catalog is to allow for object searching and deconfliction quickly without the need for referrals to other domains ([more information here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978012.aspx)).
- The nice side effect from an offensive perspective is that we can quickly query information about all domains and objects in a forest with simple queries to our primary domain controller.
- **The initial global catalog is generated on the first domain controller created in the first domain in the forest. The first domain controller for each new child domain is also set as a global catalog by default, but others can be added.**
- **"LDAP:" is a full replica of a single domain and that "GC:" is a partial replica of all domains in the forest**.
- The properties that are replicated are marked in the forest schema as the “partial attribute set”. You can easily enumerate these property names with PowerView:
```powershell
Get-DomainObject -SearchBase "CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=testlab,DC=local" -LDAPFilter "(isMemberOfPartialAttributeSet=TRUE)" | Select name
```
### Finding Global Catalogs
- Before you can interact with the global catalog it helps to know where all of them are.
- .NET has this functionality nicely built in:
```powershell
$Forest = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Forest]::GetCurrentForest()
$Forest.FindAllGlobalCatalogs()
```
- With PowerView, you can use **Get-ForestGlobalCatalog**:
### Searching the Global Catalog
- To search a global catalog with PowerView, replace “**LDAP://…**” with “**GC://**” when specifying an LDAP search string for **-SearchBase**.
- In practice you can usually use “**-SearchBase “GC://domain.com”** which will map to the global catalog for that domain.
### Group Scopes and the Global Catalog
- Group scopes matter when it comes to global catalog replication.
	- The **group memberships** of domain local groups and global groups are not replicated to the global catalog, although the **group objects** themselves are.
	- **Universal** groups are replicated along with their full memberships. Stated in another way by Microsoft, “_[Groups with universal scope, and their members, are listed exclusively in the global catalog. Groups with global or domain local scope are also listed in the global catalog, but their members are not](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759007(v=ws.10).aspx)._”
- We can easily enumerate the members of ANY universal group for ANY domain in a forest by just communicating with a domain controller in our same domain. This means that we only initiate traffic with a domain controller in our current domain.
```powershell
Get-DomainGroup -SearchBase "GC://testlab.local" -Properties grouptype,name,member -LDAPFilter '(member=*)'
```
- Member/memberof are [linked attributes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms677270(v=vs.85).aspx), meaning that the value of **memberof** (the back link) is calculated on the value of **member** (the forward link). Because the membership of universal groups _are_ replicated in the global catalog, a user’s membership in a universal group should be replicated to all GCs in the forest. However, because the membership data for domain local/global groups is _not_ replicated to the global catalog, **memberof** results for users will vary, as those backlinks may not be able to be traced. Microsoft confirms this behavior: “[_Because of the way that groups are enumerated by the Global Catalog, the results of a back-link [i.e. memb search can vary, depending on whether you search the Global Catalog (port 3268) or the domain (port 389), the kind of groups the user belongs to (global groups vs. domain local groups), and whether the user belongs to groups outside the local domain_](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978012.aspx#XSLTsection126121120120)“.
- If you bind to a global catalog in the same domain that the group membership the user is a part of, those (domain local or global) group memberships will populate **memberof**. Just remember that those results will vary depending on the domain/global catalog you bind to.
## Group Scoping and External Trusts
- Users that exist in external or forest trusts, external from the domain’s current forest, can still be added to **domain local** groups in the specified domain. These users show up as new entries in **CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=domain,DC=com**. Or, as Microsoft explains it, “[_When a trust is established between a domain in a forest and a domain outside of that forest, security principals from the external domain can access resources in the internal domain. Active Directory creates a foreign security principal object in the internal domain to represent each security principal from the trusted external domain. These foreign security principals **can become members of domain local groups** in the internal domain_](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc773178(v=ws.10).aspx)“.
- Remember that “security principals” means either groups, users, or computers, i.e. anything with a security identifier. You can enumerate these members quickly by setting the SearchBase for a search to be “CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=domain,DC=com”.
- If any of these foreign users are members of groups in your target domain, the **Get-DomainForeignGroupMember** function should tease these out as well. But remember that the only way this is possible is if the group is a **domain local** scope.
## Offensive Operations
- We can use the global catalog offensively when dealing with a multi-domain forest.
	- The first is if you get a plain samaccountname for a user/group/computer and want to know what domain the account resides in. This is what we do with the BloodHound ingestor, as the samaccountnames returned from a **Get-NetSession** result don’t contain domain names. In fact, this is one of the main reasons the global catalog was built, for object deconfliction.
	- Another option is to quickly enumerate all objects of a certain type throughout the forest, i.e. get all computer DNS names for the entire setup
	- We can go a step further and enumerate all Kerberoastable accounts in the entire forest, since the **servicePrincipalName** property is replicated.
	- This also applies to domain trusts! Trusts can be enumerated through LDAP with the **‘(objectClass=trustedDomain)’** filter.
- Unfortunately, again due to how the member/memberOf properties are linked, if a user is added to a group in a foreign domain/forest (i.e. not in a domain in the same forest) the **member** property of the particular group is updated with the foreign security principal distinguishedname, but the **memberOf** field for the user/group object added is not updated. Also, these foreign members can only be added to [domain local groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978012.aspx#XSLTsection126121120120), which are not replicated in the global catalog. So we can use the global catalog to enumerate some of the inner-forest but cross-domain memberships, but for external/forest foreign memberships we’ll have to search the **CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals** container domain by domain. Luckily for us, this data _**is**_ replicated in the global catalog! Just use **-LDAPFilter ‘(objectclass=foreignSecurityPrincipal)’**.
```powershell
Get-DomainObject -Properties name,objectsid,distinguishedname -SearchBase "GC://dev.testlab.local" -LDAPFilter '(objectclass=foreignSecurityPrincipal)' | ? {$_.objectsid -match '^S-1-5-.*-[1-9]\d{2,}$'} | fl
```
- Since we now know that external trust users can only be added to groups with a **domain local** scope, we can extract the domain the foreign user was added to from the distinguishedname, query that domain directly for domain local-scoped groups with members, and compare each against the list of foreign users:
```powershell
# query the global catalog for foreign security principals with domain-based SIDs, and extract out all distinguishednames
$ForeignUsers = Get-DomainObject -Properties objectsid,distinguishedname -SearchBase "GC://dev.testlab.local" -LDAPFilter '(objectclass=foreignSecurityPrincipal)' | ? {$_.objectsid -match '^S-1-5-.*-[1-9]\d{2,}$'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty distinguishedname
$Domains = @{}

$ForeignMemberships = ForEach($ForeignUser in $ForeignUsers) {
    # extract the domain the foreign user was added to
    $ForeignUserDomain = $ForeignUser.SubString($ForeignUser.IndexOf('DC=')) -replace 'DC=','' -replace ',','.'
    # check if we've already enumerated this domain
    if (-not $Domains[$ForeignUserDomain]) {
        $Domains[$ForeignUserDomain] = $True
        # enumerate all domain local groups from the given domain that have any membership set
        Get-DomainGroup -Domain $ForeignUserDomain -Scope DomainLocal -LDAPFilter '(member=*)' -Properties distinguishedname,member | ForEach-Object {
            # check if there are any overlaps between the domain local groups and the foreign users
            if ($($_.member | Where-Object {$ForeignUsers  -contains $_})) {
                $_
            }
        }
    }
}

$ForeignMemberships | fl
```
# Logon Types
## Logon vs. Authentication
- Logon occurs on the system to which a user is gaining access, whereas authentication is performed by the computer on which the user's account resides.
	- When you use a local account to log on to a computer, that computer performs both the logon and authentication.
	- When you use a domain account to log on to a computer, the accessed computer performs the logon but a DC in the domain that holds your user account performs the authentication.
## Authentication Types
### 1. Physical vs Remote
## Logon Types
### 1. Interactive vs Network
### 2. Local vs Domain
- A user can use a **domain** account to log on interactively, after which the user accesses a shared folder through a network logon.
	- The Interactive logon at the workstation generates a Logon/logoff event in the workstation’s Security log and an Account Logon event on the DC.
	- The Network logon generates a Logon/logoff event in the file server’s Security log and more Account Logon activity in the DC’s Security log.
- A user can use a **local** account to log on to the same two computers as above. Each computer logs both categories of events while the DC logs nothing.
## Interactive logon
- The logon process begins either when a user enters credentials in the credentials entry dialog box, or when the user inserts a smart card into the smart card reader, or when the user interacts with a biometric device. Users can perform an interactive logon by using a local user account or a domain account to log on to a computer.
- Ιnteractive logon elements and logon process.
![[authn_lsa_architecture_client.gif]]
### Local account and domain account logon
- Users can perform an interactive logon to a computer in either of two ways:
	- Locally, when the user has direct physical access to the computer, or when the computer is part of a network of computers.
		- A local logon grants a user permission to access Windows resources on the local computer.
		- A local logon requires that the user has a user account in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on the local computer.
		- The SAM protects and manages user and group information in the form of security accounts stored in the local computer registry.
		- The computer can have network access, but it is not required. Local user account and group membership information is used to manage access to local resources.
		- A network logon grants a user permission to access Windows resources on the local computer in addition to any resources on networked computers **as defined by the credential's access token**. Both a local logon and a network logon require that the user has a user account in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on the local computer. Local user account and group membership information is used to manage access to local resources, and the access token for the user defines what resources can be accessed on networked computers.
		- A local logon and a network logon are not sufficient to grant the user and computer permission to access and to use domain resources.
	-  Remotely, through Terminal Services or Remote Desktop Services (RDS), in which case the logon is further qualified as remote interactive.
- After an interactive logon, **Windows runs applications on behalf of the user**, and the user can interact with those applications.
- A local logon grants a user permission to access resources on the local computer or resources on networked computers. If the computer is joined to a domain, then the Winlogon functionality attempts to log on to that domain.
- A domain logon grants a user permission to access local and domain resources. A domain logon requires that the user has a user account in Active Directory. The computer must have an account in the Active Directory domain and be physically connected to the network. Users must also have the user rights to log on to a local computer or a domain. Domain user account information and group membership information are used to manage access to domain and local resources.
### Network logon
- A network logon can only be used after user, service, or computer authentication has taken place. During network logon, the process does not use the credentials entry dialog boxes to collect data. Instead, previously established credentials or another method to collect credentials is used. This process confirms the user's identity to any network service that the user is attempting to access. This process is typically invisible to the user unless alternate credentials have to be provided.
- When you initiate a [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (RDP) session to another workstation or server, this is a remote interactive login. You are logging in interactively with the remote machine, but you are doing it remotely. It is NOT the computer you are using to start that connection.
- To provide this type of authentication, the security system includes these authentication mechanisms:
	- Kerberos version 5 protocol
    - Public key certificates
    - Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
    - Digest
    - NTLM, for compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based systems
## Logon Types
- Windows supports different types of logon sessions. These logon types describe the ways in which users can log on to a system—for example, through the system’s local console (interactive) or through a Remote Desktop session (remote interactive). You can use local or domain accounts with each logon type. Each logon type has a corresponding logon right that the user must possess to initiate a logon of that type. When a logon event is recorded in the event log, the number of the logon type is listed. The chart below lists the different logon types. To view or modify rights assignments, open the Local Security Policy console and drill down to Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment.
- Unfortunately, when a logon event is recorded, the Security log lists only the logon type number. The type of user account and the logon type greatly affect which computer's Security log will receive a logon event and which event IDs will be logged.

|Logon Number|Logon Type|Example|Logon Right|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|Used only by the System account|System startup.||
|2|Interactive: Used to log on at the local console|User logon at console at the beginning of the day.|Log on locally|
|3|Network: Used to access a Windows resource (e.g., shared folder) from a system on the network|One example is when a computer has a mapped drive to another computer share.|Access this computer from the network|
|4|Batch Job: Used to run a scheduled task as a specified account|Task Scheduler or AT command.|Log on as a batch job|
|5|Service: Used to run a service as a specified account|Credentials for an account other than local service can be used for services such as Telnet.|Log on as a service|
|6|Proxy|||
|7|Unlock (i.e. unattended workstation with password protected screen saver)|When a screen saver locks a system, the password must be entered to access the system at the console.||
|8|NetworkCleartext (Logon with credentials sent in the clear text.)|Most often indicates a logon to IIS with "basic authentication".||
|9|NewCredentials such as with RunAs or mapping a network drive with alternate credentials.|This logon type does not seem to show up in any events. Microsoft explanation: Allows the caller to clone its current token and specify new credentials for outbound connections. The new logon session has the same local identify, but uses different credentials for other network connections.||
|10|RemoteInteractive|Terminal Services, Remote Desktop or Remote Assistance.|Log on through Terminal Services|
|11|CachedInteractive|Logon that uses cached domain credentials (such as when logging on to a laptop when away from the network).||
|12|CashedRemoteInteractive|Logon that occurs when the remote system is away from the network DC.||
|13|CashedUnlock|Unlock that occurs when the remote system is away from the network DC.||
