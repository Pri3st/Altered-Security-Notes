- From [[2. Lab Walkthrough/1st Forest (techcorp.local)/1. us.techcorp.local/1. Domain Enumeration|1. Domain Enumeration]] we discovered that the `techcorp.local` Forest has a One-Way, Transitive, Inbound Forest Trust with the `bastion.local` Forest. This means that `techcorp.local` is the trusteed domain and `bastion.local` is the trusting domain, so members of `techcorp.local` can access resources on `bastion.local` but NOT the other way around.
- Moreover, this trust is transitive, which means that the trust will be inherited by all the domains of the `techcorp.local` forest, so we can enumerate `bastion.local` as a low-privileged user of `us.techcorp.local`.

#### PAM Trusts
- The name of the forest, `bastion.local`, implies that we are dealing with a Bastion Forest.
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) facilitates Just-In-Time (JIT) Administration where users are granted elevated privileges for a restricted period to improve domain security.
- A new type of cross-forest trust (PAM trust) allows organizations to set up a new Active Directory (AD) forest, or bastion forest, where privileged accounts are isolated from what Microsoft considers to be forests that might already be compromised. A further advantage of requiring a bastion forest is that AD schema changes required to support PAM can be performed in the bastion forest, while the existing forest remains untouched. This essentially means that PAM trust provides the ability to access the production forest with high privileges without using credentials of the bastion forest. Thus, better security for the bastion forest which is much desired.
- The bastion forest contains the same groups as the organizations’ existing forest, or shadow security principals, because the PAM trust allows Security Identifiers (SIDs) to be reused. Users can be identified as candidates for group membership, and when permitted via an approved workflow, a duplicate account is created for the user in the bastion forest, added to the shadow security principal, which gives the duplicate account access to resources in the existing forest. Additionally, the bastion forest user is assigned a time-to-live (TTL) value for group membership, after which time, full membership is revoked and the user is returned to candidate status. To achieve the above, Shadow Principals are created in the bastion domain which are then mapped to DA or EA groups SIDs in the production forest.
#### Foreign Security Principals
```powershell
PS C:\Auditor> Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain bastion.local


GroupDomain             : bastion.local
GroupName               : Administrators
GroupDistinguishedName  : CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=bastion,DC=local
MemberDomain            : bastion.local

```
- We have found a FSP, meaning a member in a group in `bastion.local` which however DOES NOT BELONG to that domain.
- This FSP is a member of the builtin Administrators group in `bastion.local`. This is the local group of Administrators in the domain controller which was created BEFORE ADDS was installed on that server. This builtin group is maintained in case ADDS is uninstalled in the future (in case this server is decommissioned for example).
- Furthermore, the SID of the FSP has the `-500` extension, which indicates a "Domain Admins" group. We can easily resolve it.
```powershell
PS C:\Auditor> ConvertFrom-SID S-1-5-21-2781415573-3701854478-2406986946-500
TECHCORP\Administrator
```
- This means that the EA in `techcorp.local` is also a member of the builtin Administrators local group in `BASTION-DC`.
