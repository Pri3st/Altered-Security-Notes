- From [[2. Lab Walkthrough/1st Forest (techcorp.local)/1. us.techcorp.local/1. Domain Enumeration|1. Domain Enumeration]] we discovered that the `bastion.local` Forest has a One-Way, Transitive, Inbound Forest Trust with the `production.local` Forest. This means that `bastion.local` is the trusteed domain and `production.local` is the trusting domain, so members of `bastion.local` can access resources on `production.local` but NOT the other way around.
- Since the `bastion.local` and `production.local` forests have a transitive trust, all domains inside those forests will inherit this trust but it DOES NOT extend to any other forests, such as `techcorp.local`.
- Moreover, since `production.local` is unreachable from our forest, `techocorp.local`, we will have to access `bastion.local` to enumerate the target domain and find possible ways to escalate our privileges there. This time, we will need to impersonate a domain user of `bastion.local`, since domain users of the `techcorp.local` forest are not trusteed entities in the target domain.

### PAM Trust
- We will enumerate `production.local` for PAM Trusts using **ADModule** (**PowerView** will not help in that case).

```
- The `TrustAttributes` has the value of `1096`, indicating that this forest is managed by a bastion forest.
#### Shadow Security Principals
- Since `production.local` is managed by a bastion forest, we can enumerate **THE BASTION FOREST** for Shadow Security Principals.
- A shadow principal is an object that represents a user, group, or computer account from another forest.
- Shadow principals can be created in the **bastion** forest which contain the SID of groups, e.g. the Domain Administrators group, in the **production** forest.
- Users in the **bastion** forest are added to the ‘memberof’ attribute of the shadow principals.
- Users of the bastion forest that access resources in the production forest can carry the SID of the domain admin group along with the ticket with **TIME-LIMITED ACCESS**, being able to perform respective privileged activities such as DCPromo, scheme extensions, etc. This is an implementation of just-in-time administration (JIT).
```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-ADObject -SearchBase ("CN=Shadow Principal Configuration,CN=Services," + (Get-ADRootDSE).configurationNamingContext) -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,member,msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid | fl
Get-ADObject -SearchBase ("CN=Shadow Principal Configuration,CN=Services," + (Get-ADRootDSE).configurationNamingContext) -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,member,msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid | fl


Name                    : Shadow Principal Configuration
member                  : {}
msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid :

Name                    : prodforest-ShadowEnterpriseAdmin
member                  : {CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=bastion,DC=local}
msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid : S-1-5-21-1765907967-2493560013-34545785-519
```
- The Administrator of `bastion.local` is a member of the Shadow Security Principals which is mapped to the Enterprise Admins group of `production.local`, meaning that the Administrator of `bastion.local` has Enterprise Admin privileges on `production.local`.
