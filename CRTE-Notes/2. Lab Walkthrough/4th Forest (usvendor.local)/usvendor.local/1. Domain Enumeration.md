- We discovered from [[2. Lab Walkthrough/1st Forest (techcorp.local)/1. us.techcorp.local/1. Domain Enumeration|1. Domain Enumeration]] that the `techcorp.local` Forest has a Bidirectional `FOREST_TRANSITIVE` Trust with the `usvendor.local` Forest.
- Since this is a transitive trust, all domains in the `techcorp.local` forest will also inherit this trust, which means that we will be able to enumerate the domain as a domain user of `us.techcorp.local`.

#### Foreign Security Principals
- Since we have found nothing interesting so far, we can search for all group members of domain groups in the `usvendor.local` domain where the member is not in `usvendor.local`.
