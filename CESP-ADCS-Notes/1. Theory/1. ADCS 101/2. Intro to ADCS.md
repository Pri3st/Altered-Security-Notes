#### ADC101 ####
- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a Windows Server role for issuing and managing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates used in secure communication and authentication protocols.
- The issued certificates can be used to encrypt emails, signing documents, performing certificate-based authentication of a user/computer/device account and much more.
- PKI authentication is an alternative to standard password authentication. It employs asymmetric encryption using digital signatures and certificates for encryption and authentication.

#### ADCS Components ####
- **Certification Authority (CA)**: Issues and manages certificates using Certificate Templates. AD CS CAs can be implemented as – RootCAs and SubCAs (Requires AD CS role to be installed).
- **Certificate Template**: Defines settings for a certificate. Contains information like - enrolment permissions, EKUs, expiry etc. These templates are collections of enrollment policies and predefined certificate settings and contain things like “_How long is this certificate valid for?_”, _“What is the certificate used for?”,_ “_How is the subject specified?_”, _“Who is allowed to request a certificate?”_, and a myriad of other settings.
- **Certificate Enrollment Web Service (CES)**: Permits Windows users, computers and applications to enroll and renew certificates using the HTTPS protocol through Web Enrollment endpoints.
- **Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service**: Enables users to obtain certificate enrollment policy information. 
- **CA Web Enrollment**: Provides a method to issue and renew certificates in scenarios where users use devices that are not joined to the domain or are running operating systems other than Windows.
- **Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES)**: With this component, routers, switches, and other offline network devices can obtain certificates from AD CS (Ex: Microsoft Intune).

#### Active Directory: Public Key Services ####
- In Active Directory, the configuration is stored under the following location (Configuration partition, thus defined at forest-level):
`CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=lab,DC=local`
- The configuration can be viewed using the `adsiedit.msc` component in the MMC:
![[public_key_services.png]]

- **AIA**: This container is used to store intermediate CA certificates and cross-certificates. This container may contain entries of **certificateAuthority** type. CA certificates are written to `cACertificate` attribute and cross-certificates are written to `crossCertificatePair` attribute. All certificates from this container are propagated to each client as a part of group policy processing to client’s Intermediate Certification Authorities container.
-  **CDP (CRL (_Certificate revocation list_) Distribution Point)**: This container aims at providing the domain with Certificate Revocation Lists for each enterprise ADCS server installed. Therefore, each sub-container has an object, which contains the CRL (optionally delta CRL) in the `certificateRevocationList` (optionally `deltaRevocationList`).
- **Certificate templates _Container_**: The CertificateTemplate container has one domain object of type `pKICertificateTemplate` for every template to be shared among the enterprise Certification Authorities. These templates define, through attributes configured on their domain object, a set of policies that mostly describe and constrain:
	- **General settings:** the validity period of the delivered certificates
	- **Request handling:** the purpose of the certificate and the ability to export the private key (although this can be bypassed if the private key is generated prior to the certificate request, for example with the `certreq` binary)
	- **Cryptography:** the Cryptographic Services Provider (CSP) to be used and the minimum key size
	- **Extensions:** the list of X509v3 extensions to be included in the certificate, and their criticality (including the `KeyUsage` and `ExtendedKeyUsages`)
	- **Subject name**, which dictates how the Distinguished Name of the certificate is built: either from a user-supplied value in the request, or from the identity of the domain principal requesting the certificate
	- **Issuance requirements**_:_ the need for a “CA certificate manager” approval in order to deliver the certificate
	- **Security descriptor**_:_ the ACL of the certificate template, including the identity of the principals who have the extended right needed to enroll to the template 
- **Enrollment Services _Container_**: The Enrollment Services provides domain principals with the list of enterprise ADCS servers with the domain. The attributes of these objects describe these Certification Authorities, how the principals can reach them, and what they are authorized to do:
	- The `dNSHostName` attribute corresponds to the FQDN (or alias) of the ADCS server
	- The `certificateTemplates` attribute lists a **subset of the Certificate Templates** that the principals are allowed to request certificates for from this Certification Authority
	- The **Security Descriptor** (available through the “Security” tab) lists the actions that principals are allowed to do on the Certification Authority or the current domain object: enroll, modify the list of certificate templates, etc.
- **NtAuthCertificates _Entry_**: The NtAuthCertificates (also known as _NtAuth enterprise store_) is a domain object which contains a list of CA certificates (in the `cACertificate` attribute). This list dictates which certificates will be valid for authentication purposes across the domain, as authentication services will look for the direct issuer CA within this enterprise store. It is important to note that workstations and servers (including Domain Controllers) keep a **local cached** version of this store in the Windows Registry, at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EnterpriseCertificates\NTAuth\Certificates`
- **KRA**: This container is used to store key recovery agent certificates for each Enterprise CA. When Enterprise CA issues a certificate based on Key Recovery Agent template, it automatically adds it to a corresponding entry. If this is first KRA certificate, CA creates a record for itself and writes KRA certificate to userCertificate attribute. Certificates from KRA container are exposed only when you assign new key recovery agent to CA server.
- **OID**: This container is used to store object identifiers (OID) registered in enterprise. OID container can hold object identifier definitions for custom Application Policies, Issuance (Certificate) Policies and certificate templates. When client is a member of the Active Directory forest, it uses OID container to resolve object identifiers along with local OID database. New OIDs should be registered via Certificate Templates (certtmpl.msc).


#### ADCS Interaction ####
- The heart of the day-to-day interactions with ADCS and CA servers resides in the **certificate templates** and **enrollment services**:
- Each **enrollment service** links to a **CA server** with the ADCS role – **additional settings** can be configured **locally** on a per-server basis, mainly stored in the registry.
- The **enrollment service** lists a **subset of the certificate templates** published.
![[adcs_interaction.png]]

- In order to request a certificate, the user / computer must: ​
	- Have the **enrollment rights** on the **Enrollment Service**
	- _And_ have the **enrollment rights** on the **target Certificate Template**​
	- Be able to reach the CA server on **port 135** (RPC) and **high dynamic ports** (usually start at 49152)

#### PKINIT ####
- The type of pre-authentication to be used is described in the `padata-type` field of the `AS-REQ` request. The most common value is `PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP`, which works by **encrypting a timestamp token with one of the user’s secrets** (NT hash, AES key, etc.). This is considered  a use of **symmetric cryptographic protocols** since it relies in the shared secrets derived from the password).
- Kerberos authentication using smartcards relies on the `PA-PK-AS-REQ` value and uses the **PKINIT** protocol. This protocol defines how public key cryptography can be used as a pre-authentication mechanism in Kerberos.
- Like in the standard mode, a **timestamp token is generated** that will later ensure the freshness of the authentication.
- **This token is signed** with the user’s private key, **the corresponding certificate is sent in the AS-REQ packet** and, depending on the type of mapping intended (explicit or implicit), either a principal name or hints can be used to locate the principal.
- Once the Active Directory object is located, the certificate will have to meet the NT_AUTH policy, i.e. having its **direct issuer’s certificate included in the NtAuth enterprise store**.
- The authentication server will then verify that the certificate `Enhanced Key Usage - EKU` extension contains either “**Client Authentication**” (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`), “**Microsoft Smartcard Logon**” (`1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2`), “**Key Purpose Client Auth**” (`1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4`) or “**Any purpose**” (`2.5.29.37.0`).
- Finally, the KDC will verify that the certificate provided **links to a trusted root Certification Authority**, is **valid** (dates and revocation) and that the **signature of the timestamp token is cryptographically correct**. If all checks pass, the user is provided with a TGT for the located AD object.
